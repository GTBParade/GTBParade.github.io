## Album Release Reception and Attention.

The Black Parade was released by Alt-Rock/Pop-Punk Band My Chemical Romance on October 24, 2006 in the United States, and a day earlier in Europe.
The band rose to new heights, going from performing in sweaty crammed basements to selling out stadiums. The album was critically acclaimed by most
critics, due to being a well respected and rarely attempted rock opera album. The album redefined the emo/pop-punk scene entirely, with it's 4 
beloved singles:

With over 300 Million views on YouTube, and over half

## Tracklisting And Individual Track-Dissection and Analysis.

### Track 1. The End.

The End. (The period is part of the title) is the opening track of this masterpiece, very similiar to the opening of "The Wall" by Pink Floyd, how
the song suddenly drops into soaring guitar harmonies, the heavily layered vocal harmonies and grand elements to the song establish it's place as
a rock opera, building up at the end of the song before perfectly transitioning into the song "Dead!"

### Track 2. Dead!

Dead! (Excalmation Point Included) is the second track of the album, it's a very fast and energetic song, it's almost cheerful and happy despite
the song topic being so morbid, it's sinister disregard of the patient's life and how nonchalant the thought of disappearing from the face of the
earth is treated is perfect, perfectly capturing how the emo genre takes negative things and turns it into a fun, happy, and energetic journey.

### Track 3. This Is How I Disappear

This Is How I Disappear is a very dark and disturbing third track, it deals with the thought of the patient's lover and how their rocky, abusive relationship
is affected by the eventual death of the patient, how they speak of seances, and establishing a romantic connection with the dead, not to mention the absolutely
crushing breakdown where the patient breaks down, screaming about how they can't hurt them anymore due to being dead.

### Track 4. The Sharpest Lives

The Sharpest Lives is a classic and catchy rock song, the lyrical talent of lead singer Gerard Way truly shines in this song, a song about how the patient would
rather kill themself instead of letting their illness catch up to them, taking their own life instead of letting death do it. The song deals with alcohol and drug
use, how the patient is actively trying to take the pain away by drinking themself to death, living The Sharpest Life he can before he eventually passes.

### Track 5. Welcome To The Black Parade

Welcome To The Black Parade is a generational anthem and is a perfect fifth track, one of the greatest songs to ever be released, if not the greatest.
Welcome To The Black Parade is the leading single of The Black Parade, it's lyrics deal with the concept of how death takes you in the form of your fondest memory.
In the song, the depicted patient's fondest memory is visiting the city to see a marching band with his father, which is why death takes him in the form of **The Black Parade**.

Not only is the song unbelievably iconic, but the unique marching band elements mixed in to the rock opera are absolutely gorgeous, the song takes it to the next level
with a key change and gorgeous guitar solo with harmonies, Lead Guitarist Ray Toro was very clearly influenced by Queen's Brian May, due to the structure of the guitars.
This song is an absolute masterpiece, the writing is fantastic and has pieces of death scattered around in it, and the song itself is catchy, memorable and has a grand ending
where the tempo is cut in half, the vocals are roaring and absolutely unbelievably, reaching the highest notes any male can hit, and soaring guitars and marching band elements.

### Track 6. I Don't Love You

I Don't Love You is a slow sixth song, a relaxing and somber track to slow the pace down after the first 4 fast tracks and of course, "Welcome To The Black Parade" 
It deals with the patient's lover once again, how their rocky relationship was going before the patients death. The song doesn't explore as much interesting areas
of the bands musical genius, however it didn't need any thing unbelievable and grand, it's a perfectly written and produced slow rock song that's perfectly
adequate and classic in it's style.
